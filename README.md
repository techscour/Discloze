#Welcome To Discloze

###Disclose is a demonstration site built with Rails 4, Angular, and Bootstrap JS. It's a second generation social site that lets everyone selectively share life lists with both people and programs.

###Some technical highlights include authentication using the Stormpath authentication service, SendGrid mailing, a token authenticated partner API, hybrid Rails/Javascipt processing of form/list pages, and a JQuery Mobile app</a>. This app is deployed on Heroku from a continuous Codeship build. It's monitored by New Relic plus Googe Analytics, and it's tested with RSpec, Cucumber, Capybara, and Poltergeist.
